# *Accessing Data Members inside a Class*

### The access.cpp file contains an example code of how we can acess public data members in a class. 

#### The data members and member functions of class can be accessed using the dot(‘.’) operator with the object. For example if the name of object is obj and you want to access the member function with the name printname() then you will have to write obj.printname() .
